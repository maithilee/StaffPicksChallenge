Join us as we twist and turn to contemplate reality through a different glass.  The Opening Titles for OFFF Pescara & Webfest 2012 were created in a true Physalia spirit, striving to find new ways to move a camera in reality with a control only possible in CG. This time around, we created our biggest rig ever- a multi-sized orbital crane half human-powered, half computer controlled. The different sizes of our rig allowed us to engage in a multi-dimensional trip- from the macro shots taken inside the Lightbox, to the highest flights in the woods.  The Titles were shot in stopmotion with an infrared camera hacked by ourselves- more than 10.000 raw infrared images compose them. The final film has no CG imagery and was shot entirely in stopmotion.

Under the basement, though, there would be a trench that not God, Father of the preset Father, dug, but a cursed, unknown old man, who had died before the Son was born. \n\nSince a time before memory existed, the cadaverous organism of Foredeath has been residing in this tomb, and even God has no power over it. \n\nThere are no words to describe the blasphemy inflicted upon people, committed in that inconceivable absolute darkness, with not a single bright atom. \n\nFyodorov understood at once and forever that everybody would die, and that he, Fyodor, would also die, and this is the worst thing that could ever happen. \n\nAlphabet blocks with multi-colored letters revealed to Fyodorov the awful mystery.  When his Babylon made out of wooden blocks toppled into pieces, the letters formed the Eternal Word. And the Word was uttered, and it was the truth about death. \n\nNo adult would ever bear the burden of such a revelation. Fyodorov managed to compose himself, he withstood, and only occasionally would he burst into tears, and then\u2026nobody could calm him down, neither his mother and grandmother, nor the doctors with their hallucinatory medicine. \n\nHuman life is like running through a minefield, where mines are planted not only in the ground, but also in the clouds, beetles, flies, grasshoppers, mist, in the rustling of grass stems or in the ringing from faraway bell towers. \n\nEverywhere were many special traps, and though not all of them were instantly fatal, each one brought the end closer. \n\nThe traps were guarded by the Beasts. Fyodorov learned about the Beasts from the prayers his grandmother would sometimes read, asking to be saved from the Aphid and from the mental Wolf. \n\nFyodorov himself never saw the Beasts, but he imagined them very clearly. Once you might be caught off and not notice that the Mental Wolf had devoured the former meaning of things, and the Aphid had infected you with the deadly decay and turned you into Carrion, which is the Sin. \n\nIf a man is full of sinful Carrion, he dies. What made Fyodorov different from other people was that he learned to create antidote rituals \u2013 acts, supported by a short prayer, as dictated by the blocks. \n\nTo leave the apartment safely, Fyodorov would stroke the door knob five times and say Rock-a-bye, baby. If a stranger or an old woman with a poodle appears, he would return home, walking backwards. He would run into the kitchen, touch the table, press his cheek to the fridge, and only after all that did he stroke the door knob\u2026 by no means saying \u201cRock-a-bye, baby\u201d because the baby is not rocking anymore. Instead, you should say: \u201cRiddance, riddance \u2013 good riddance.\u201d\n\nAt some point Fyodorov stopped going outdoors. At first he allowed himself to look out of the window, but soon he closed the curtains forever, to limit the influx of images. \n\nThe Beasts were not dozing. The Wolf gobbled the meaning of bread and water \u2013 the last bits of Fyodorov\u2019s poor rations, and the Aphid turned them into Carrion immediately. \n\nThen the fatal moment came, when Fyodorov didn\u2019t manage to reach for the blocks. The Mental Wolf and the Aphid were patiently waiting for their prey\u2026\n\n\u2026 But the essence is unknown to The Beasts. In Fyodorov\u2019d end is hidden the great defeat of Foredeath, because Foredeath has no right to him. Of all living creatures he is the only one not contaminated by the cadaverous organism of carrion, but instead filled with the Eternal Word.\nAnd when Fyodorov \u2018s spirit leaves him, a new realm of death will expand in the black emptiness left behind. This new realm will be stretched as a net over the former, and it will catch everyone. From then on everybody will be dying into Fyodorov\u2019s death. Nobody knows what it will exactly feel like, but even if we are reincarnated as simple alphabet blocks with coloured letters, at least no one will ever get us or trouble us \u2013 not the mad old man, not Father, the Mental Wolf nor the Aphid. \n", "categories": [], "image": "https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/54025997_780x439.webp"}

In 2012 Salazar set out across Canada driving over 2600 Kilometers from Vancouver, British Columbia to the village of Angusville, Manitoba to create Silver Creek. Over the course of 2 weeks the people of Angusville embraced our little band and our project, letting us shut down main street for days on end, invade their backyards, and throw confetti literally everywhere.  We cast local actors and kids from around the region and many residents came out to be background actors. Every night our crew and the community broke bread together in the town hall. It was a profoundly unique experience for all involved. For two weeks a band of 50 odd people came together as a family, we lived together, and got to play together at making a film. This tight knit togetherness fit with the spirit of what our film was trying to convey.

As an antidote to this pattern of rapid obsolescence, the British design-consulting firm Kinneir Dufort developed its Revive smartphone concept, proposing a device that can evolve over time rather than be cast aside when it breaks or something newer and shinier hits the market. Unlike existing products on the market, it would be designed for easy disassembly, so the end user could replace or upgrade components without tossing the entire phone.\n\nService providers and manufacturers would be able to charge for these improvements, replacing revenue they would have earned from selling new phones. To help it age gracefully, Revive would be made from materials \u2014 leathers, metals and plastic composites \u2014 that acquire a patina from wear. A service subscription, meanwhile, would offer the user credits the longer he held on to the phone, making him a \u201cstakeholder\u201d with an investment in the longevity of the product.\" JESSE ASHLOCK\n\nCredits:\nSean Pecknold: Director, Writer, Animator,\nBritta Johnson: Editor, Props, Set Design, Art Department\nJustin Braegelmann: Sound Design\n", "categories": [], "image": "https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/120285035_780x439.webp"}

So a bit like what I did with Sofia's People (but I didn't have the Zacuto rig for that).\n\nI shot 1/50th of a second as I was shooting 24p and to match the 50hz frequency of the artificial all around me in Temple Bar.\n\nI also shot some stuff 720p 50p with shutter at 1/100th to get the slow motion shots of the juggler which were conformed to 23.98p in Cinema tools to create the beautiful slow motion. \n\nSound on the last bit was just the internal mono cam mic as I didn't want a big mic on top of the camera.\n\nBig thanks To Darragh and Emma for organizing the workshop. To all the people attended and especially the people who came to the intensive 1 day Cinematography practical workshop on Sunday. Jala (from Germany), Cathal (from N.

Adding more details according to questions I've been recieving:   It was shot in a homemade \"studio\" that I made in a cabinet. I covered the back of the cabinet with black cloth, the flower was placed in the middle, and the whole cabinet was then covered with another cloth to insulate from the daylight (to keep the light constant, which is the most important). Two led lamps were used to illuminate the flowers.  Some flowers bloomed in hours, some in few days.. therefore the interval between photos varies from few seconds to several minutes depending on the type of flower.. after several missed tries you'll learn ;)   In order to keep ISO as low as possible (couldn't go lower than 640 because of low light), the shutter speed was usually 1/5 s at f16.

It was pretty hard looping like this because every timing error made was amplified each time round, so that in the end the loops were totally out of sync with the metronome in my ear!\n\nI broke a couple of things when I was making this. But mum shrank a good jumper of mine a few days before, so we decided to call it even. It was a GREAT jumper though...\n\nThe good news is that mum and dad got a new toaster and it has a button on the side that, when pressed, makes the bread gently lower into the toaster and some shiny doors slide across to keep the heat in so it's more efficient. It makes toast more exciting, which, if you have it with something like blueberry jam, is almost TOO exciting.\n\nFor more music check www.simonpanrucker.com", "categories": [], "image": "https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/53834061_780x439.webp"}
